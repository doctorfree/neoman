## Neoman installation

The initial installation of Neoman should be performed by a user with
`sudo` privileges, not the `root` user. Issue the following two commands:

```bash
# Install neoman with the following two commands:
git clone https://github.com/doctorfree/neoman $HOME/.config/neoman
$HOME/.config/neoman/neoman
```

Subsequent use of the `neoman` command does not require `sudo` privilege and
can be performed by any user.

After installation is complete, run the `neoman` command to get started
managing your `Neoman` system.
